# ▶️ Basic statistics
General statistics

# ▶️ Per base sequence quality
X-axis: individual bases for the read
yellow box: interquartile range
red line: median value
blue line: mean value

Good quality: above 20

# ▶️ Per sequence quality scores
Mean score across all the bases in the particular sequence

# ▶️ Per base sequence content
Good quality: even distribution of the four bases
If the volatility is not significant it is still ok

# ▶️ Per base GC content
Good quality: flat
RNA seq: a wobble in the first sort of nine or ten bases

# ▶️ Per base GC content
Distribution of GC content across sequences
theoretical line will be provided

Spikes can indicate contamimants presence

# ▶️ Per base N content
uncalled bases
Good quality: no uncalled bases

# ▶️ Sequence Length Distribution
Informative plot
If a library is all the same length or not

# ▶️ Sequence Duplication Levels
 First is always 100%, other good sequences values depends on variety of starting parameters.

# ▶️ Overrepresented sequences
Looks at duplicated sequences in a different way
Looks for individual sequences that are over represented within the set
